## Building `ocgcore` of EDOPro on Termux

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build the `ocgcore` library of EDOPro on Termux. Follow the steps below to ensure all dependencies are installed and the build process is completed successfully.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **GCC**: Required for compiling C++ code.
2. **Make**: Necessary for running Makefiles generated by Premake5.
3. **ndk-multilib**: Provides the necessary libraries for building.
4. **build-essential**: Includes essential build tools.
5. **Premake5 & gmake2**: Used for generating Makefiles.
6. **Lua**: Required for scripting support.

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the `ygopro-core` repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/edo9300/ygopro-core.git
```

#### 2. Install Build-Essential & GCC & Make & Ndk-Multilib
```sh
pkg install build-essential gcc make ndk-multilib
```

#### 3. Install Premake5 & gmake2

Clone the Premake5 repository and build it:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/premake/premake-core.git
cd premake-core
make -f Bootstrap.mak linux
```
Copy the `premake5` executable to the appropriate directory:
```sh
cp bin/release/premake5 /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin
```

#### 4. Install Lua

Run the installation script for Lua:
```sh
cd ygopro-core
./scripts/install-lua.sh
```

### Building `ocgcore`

After installing all dependencies, proceed with building `ocgcore`:

1. Navigate to the `ygopro-core` directory (if you are not in it):
    ```sh
    cd ygopro-core
    ```

2. Generate the Makefiles using Premake5:
    ```sh
    premake5 gmake2
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cd build
    make config=release
    ```

And that's it! Good luck.
